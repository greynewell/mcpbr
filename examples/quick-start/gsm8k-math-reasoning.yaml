# GSM8K Math Reasoning Configuration
#
# Use this configuration to evaluate your MCP server on grade-school
# math word problems. Tests mathematical reasoning and chain-of-thought
# capabilities.
#
# Steps:
# 1. Update the mcp_server section if needed
# 2. Run: mcpbr run -c examples/quick-start/gsm8k-math-reasoning.yaml -v
# 3. Review results to see how well the agent solves math problems
#
# Expected runtime: 30-60 minutes (for 50 problems)
# Expected cost: $3-8

mcp_server:
  # Default: Filesystem server (agents may create Python scripts for calculations)
  command: "npx"
  args:
    - "-y"
    - "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem"
    - "{workdir}"
  env: {}

  Solve the following grade-school math problem step-by-step:

  {problem_statement}

  Show your reasoning clearly. You can use Python for calculations if needed.
  Make sure to provide your final answer as a number.
  End with: "The answer is: [number]"
